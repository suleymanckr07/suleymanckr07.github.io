The file /woo-ai-website/woo-ai-website/css/bootstrap.min.css is typically a minified version of the Bootstrap CSS framework. Since this is a standard library file, I cannot generate its contents directly. You would need to download the Bootstrap framework from the official Bootstrap website or use a package manager to include it in your project.

If you need help with anything else or want to create a custom CSS file, please let me know!
